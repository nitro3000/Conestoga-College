//For your Lesson 2 assignment, I would like you to use an array to figure out which day of the week is the best for a fictional business.
// Write a program to ask a user for sales information. For each sale, have the user enter the day of the week and the amount of the sale.
// Store total sales for each day of the week in an array, and after the last sale is entered,
// list the sales for each day and tell which day had the highest sales.
//If you are looking for a tougher challenge, you can also store the number of sales for each day
// and calculate the average amount of each sale for each day of the week.
